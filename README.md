The quickest way to find out what it means exactly:

* [Introduction to US Federal Government Contracts](/notebooks/contracts_intro.ipynb)


## Usage

### Data

* [`data`](/data)

The data is collected from government websites and loaded to [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/):

Data | BigQuery dataset | Source
--- | --- | ---
US Federal Government contracts (2000â€“2016) | [gpqueries:contracts](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/gpqueries:contracts) | [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/DownloadCenter/Pages/dataarchives.aspx)

For the codebooks, see [`data`](/data).

### Queries

* [`queries`](/queries) 

All queries are written for the BigQuery SQL dialect and stored in `.sql` files. Each file contains comments about its purpose and usage.

You can execute queries with:

- [BigQuery Web GUI](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/)
- [Google Datalab](https://datalab.cloud.google.com/)
- [Google Cloud Platform SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/): `bq` tool (see `bq help query` for details)

All methods require a Google Account and a Google Cloud Project. Both are free. The first-time setup takes a couple of minutes.

Web GUI is the easiest to start with.
