# Government Procurement Datasets

* *The datasets are stored on BigQuery. See [README.md](../README.md) for details.*

The files in this this directory describe the variables used in the datasets. The files are named after the datasets: `<dataset>.<table>.md`.

For example, to find the description of the original variables used in US federal government contracts, open [`contracts.raw.md`](contracts.raw.md).
